## Week 01

### Day 1 - 26/11/2035

installed vite and configured tailwind.
implemented darkmode and began creating a profile card.

### End of Week 1

learned a lot about how AI can be helpful but also get stuck in unhelpful loops without realising or relying on outdated documentation. Careful to get help but rarely having any success with use of agents except for helpful code snippet prediction from time to time.
Found a tailwind csss 2025 video which was really helpful in solving my tailwind installation problem. I'd like to move onto Daisy UI fairly quick even though I want to still learn more about tailwind.
I spent far too much time configuring this week but I am glad I landed there in the end. Pushing now to the repo because its working for dark and light mode and the profile card is complete.
